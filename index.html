            <p>Candace has been a Technology Teacher since October 2014. Previously, she taught both 3rd
            and 4th grade for a total of 8 years. She works to inspire and impact every student she comes in contact with. She provides
            her students with as many opportunities in robotics, coding, and in preparation for the rapid advances in technology that
            will eventually change how we all live, communicate and work.</p>
            
            <p>The most rewarding part of her position is watching her students
            create, design and build projects on their own. Everyday, her students are challenged to problem solve, work collaboratively
            with a team and show perserverance. These lifelong skills will help her students think “outside the box” and learn the value
            of working as a team. She hopes to inspire her students to join future programming, engineering, designing, and computer
            science careers.</p>
